It is not necessary that every change requires changes in all the components, you can uncheck the components as required. Don't worry if you are not sure, just keep all the above components.

A **single PR** should be submitted for all the parts. The commits need **to be separate** for all of them.

**Note**: You can only submit a patch if it is approved by one of the maintainers, otherwise the PR will be rejected.
